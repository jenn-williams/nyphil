    <h1 class="text-center"> Early History of American Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic</h1>
    <div class = "row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p>While the tradition of classical music in Europe operated as “a canon of homegrown symphonies,” classical music in America combined elements of European culture and emphasized performativity to form the basis of a new musical heritage (Horowitz xiii). Throughout the nineteenth century, a number of transatlantic exchanges occurred between American and European musicians. American artists would often study abroad in Europe, adopting the style and technical methods of European classics. At the same time, a rapidly changing political climate in Europe lead many musicians and artists to search for a musical community beyond their homelands.</p>
        <p>Ureli Corelli Hill, an American-born violinist, would be such an example. Traveling often to England and Germany in the late 1830s, Hill played alongside a number of European orchestras (Spritzer). In 1842, Hill returned to New York City to establish the New York Philharmonic, one of the first orchestras of its kind built on U.S soil. His return to the United States coincided with the social and economic circumstances needed for such an institution to form (Salet). Hill’s experience abroad greatly affected the trajectory of the New York Philharmonic. He found himself offended by some methods, i.e, the English and their abrupt finales. Hill was not alone in his vision for the New York Philharmonic. In contrast, he was devoted to many German musical traits, whether it was a flexible and expressive conducting style, or the open rehearsals that allowed for public accessibility (Horowitz).</p></div>

        <div class = "col-sm-6">
        <p>Principle prominent conductors of the New York Philharmonic shared an equal interest and investment in German musical tradition. Conductors Carl Bergmann, Theodore Thomas, Leopold and Walter Damrosch, and Gustav Mahler-- key players in the development of the New York Philharmonic, augmented classical music styles to formulate what may now be seen as a concrete American orchestra tradition. These conductors would utilize technical skills and business practices to help bring the NYP into greater prominence within the American musical community.</p>
        <p>Today, the New York Philharmonic remains as one of the oldest orchestras in the United States, and one of the oldest in the world. In the year of its establishment in 1842, only three concerts were held over the course of the year, open exclusively to musicians’ families and friends. It was not until 1851 that the NY Philharmonic opened its doors to the general public (Horowitz).</p>
        <p>Within the span of one hundred years, the New York Philharmonic would grow exponentially-- an expanding of venues and musical repertoire would allow the orchestra to reach a larger audience in New York City and across the country. The Origins of the New York Philharmonicproject aims to explore the foundations and critical history of the New York Philharmonic.</p></div>
