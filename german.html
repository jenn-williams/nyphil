    <h2>German Influence</h2>
    <p>Many notable early conductors all shared a firm connection to German musical processes-- either through interpersonal influence or by direct lineage. Carl Bergmann, Theodore Thomas, Leopold and Walter Damrosch, and Gustav Mahler are principal conductors noted for their contributions to the early rise of the New York Philharmonic, as well as their ties to German orchestra culture. The bar graph below is a general overview of early prominent conductors, representing the demographic breakdown of composers played by nationality. The second set of bar graphs hones in on each conductor, illuminating the individual composers played.</p>

         <p>In the mid 1800s, New York found itself in the midst of an enormous shift in musical culture. German musicians-- primarily immigrants fleeing Germany following the collapse of the German Revolutions of 1848, had begun to oust English and American musicians from many prominent theatre orchestras. Immigration during this period jumped sharply, reaching its peak of nearly 1.5 million in the decade 1881-1890 and declining fiercely after the start of WWI. For nearly 70 years, German musicians dominated the culture of musical performance and symphonic orchestra. German, rather than American or English compositions, began to be played during intermissions and interludes of most performances, and German dominated as the primary language of most rehearsals (Martin). The wave of German immigrants in the 1840s would considerably reorient the American orchestra scene. This influx of German musicians was accompanied by a rise in German audiences. The 1840s featured programming of Sunday concerts, choral societies, and concerts held in beer gardens-- all rooted in German tradition (Spitzer).</p></div>
         <div class = "col-sm-6">
    <p>Within the New York Philharmonic, Germans made up nearly 40% of all musicians by 1848, increasing to 80% by 1875. By this time, Germans totaled to 30% of the general population of New York state. Every conductor within the NYP from 1852-1902 identified as of German or Austrian descent (Horowitz). After Prussia’s defeat of France in 1870, Otto von Bismarck’s leadership (1864-1870) called for the unification of diverse German states into one single, militaristic, absolutist monarchy. In the previous century, Frederick the Great of Prussia had played the flute and composed -- the new German Emperor, William I, had no interests in developing the arts and humanities. This political climate caused many musicians to set their sights elsewhere, conceding that no first rate musical organization could be created in Germany at this time (Martin). Until World War I, nearly 70% of the orchestra’s yearly repertoire consisted of works by German-Austrian composers (Horowitz). While all conductors of the New York Philharmonic contributed greatly to the development of the orchestra scene in America, the role of early German influence should be highlighted. </p></div></div></div>

    <p>It is evident that the rise of German immigrants to the U.S. in the nineteenth century influenced the composition of the Philharmonic, as well as the primary audience catered to. The large sum of German transplants may have influenced how conductors built their musical repertoires-- what does the audience prefer, what does the audience want to hear? This prediction is made visible with the stacked bar graph illustrating composer’s countries of origin, relative to popular conductors. Out of five prominent conductors― Carl Bergmann, Theodore Thomas, Leopold Damrosch, Walter Damrosch, and Gustav Mahler, over 60% of pieces performed were composed by Germans. The break up of individual composers played by prominent conductors shows a pattern in popular German works. During Bergmann, Thomas and Leopold Damrosch’s era (1850-1880), Beethoven was the highest played composer with Wagner following up as a close second. In contrast, Walter Damrosch and Gustav Mahler’s era (1880-1910) would see Wagner as surpassing Beethoven in popularity. While these trends may be reflective of conductor’s personal taste, it may also point towards the changing musical preferences of American audiences.
