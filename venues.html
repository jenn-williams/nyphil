    <p> Between 1842 and 1911, the NY Philharmonic performed a total of 5,968 times within various venues across New York City. These venues, arranged from least to most performance instances, include Century Theatre (13), Castle Garden (22), Broadway Tabernacle (23), New York Theatre Roof (24), Chickering Hall (40), Brooklyn Academy of Music (65), New Theatre (130), Niblo’s Garden, 191, Steinway Hall (276), Apollo Rooms (303), Metropolitan Opera House (489), Academy of Music (1094), and Carnegie Hall (3298).  The map below shows where the NY Philharmonic venues were located. From the map, it is clear that the programs took place all over New York City. These venues were instrumental to the development of musical communities across the city.</p>

    <p>Before the construction of a claimed venue, the New York Philharmonic performed nomadically across the city. Between 1856 and 1886, they performed primarily in the Academy of Music, a 4,000-person capacity opera house built in 1854. On October 3, 1854, the New York Times published a critical review of the venue, describing the viewing experience as follows: “It appears to have been the special device of the architect to keep every spectator as far from the stage as possible...in the Amphitheatre, we doubt if a thousand persons could, by any possibility, catch a glimpse of what was going on. A new system of placing the chairs might remedy this defect” (NY Times, 3 Oct 1854). The Academy of Music failed to facilitate an enjoyable viewing experience, disappointing audience members. In 1886, the Academy of Music burnt down, causing the Philharmonic to seek alternative venues.</p>
    <p>The Philharmonic found refuge in the Metropolitan Opera House, which opened its doors on October 22, 1883 and was designed by architect Josiah Cleaveland Cady. The Philharmonic transitioned to this new venue under the direction of conductor Theodore Thomas. The Metropolitan required more funds to hold performances (Martin). Moreover, conductors Theodore Thomas and Walter Damrosch criticized the venue’s oversized stage and poor acoustics for their esteemed musical performances (Peyser). </p>
    <p>The NY Phil and New York City as a whole, were in dire need for a music-centric performance space. Existing opera houses, theatres, and halls failed to satisfy the vision of the early leading conductors of New York City. Conductors Walter Damrosch and Theodore Thomas were disheartened by a proper music venue, proclaiming that such a space would drastically transform the value and experience of orchestral music in New York (Peyser).</p></div>

<p>In the 1889 Musical Courier, Thomas wrote: “There can be no doubt that when we can
give our people the best orchestral music under the best conditions, there will be an immense
popular appetite created for it, such an appetite as does not and cannot exist now for very obvious reasons. At present New York has no place in which orchestral concerts can be effectively given...The fine effects of the orchestra are lost in the vast recesses of the stage...With
a perfect music hall we shall be able to reach that part of the public which does not at present go
to hear music from a sense of duty.” Indeed, Thomas believed that such a space was an integral part of the experience of orchestral music, “an absolute necessity for the proper interpretation of orchestral music” (Peyser).

<p>In 1887, after the death of his father, Walter Damrosch set sail to Germany to study with the conductor Hans von Bulow. It was during this voyage that Damrosch met Andrew Carnegie, a prominent steel tycoon and one of the wealthiest businessmen of the 19th century. Walter Damrosch shared his desire for a new concert hall in New York City. Carnegie supported Damrosch’s vision, and invited him to his Scotland estate to further discuss his plans (Carnegie Hall). Damrosch persuaded Carnegie to “build a music hall for the advancement of music in New York City and as a center for the cultivation of the arts and the stimulation of civic betterment” (Peyser). Carnegie would agree to fund the initial costs of the hall to establish the venue, but it could only be a sustainable pursuit by charging the audience with concert tickets and seasonal subscriptions.
</p>
<p>Carnegie Hall filled the void of an orchestral music venue in New York City, creating a “self-sustaining” (Peyser), and as W. Damrosch describes “sacred temple….[and] shrine to be treasured by all lovers of music” (Peyser, xvi). In parallel to Thomas, Damrosch was eager to build a space that offered the audience a novel music listening experience, the absolute “best conditions...to educate as well as delight” (Peyser).</p>
 <p>Between 1842 and 1911, over half of the Philharmonic’s performances took place at Carnegie Hall. Although the performances of NY Phil toured across NYC and America at large, Carnegie Hall was a legitimized homebase. Walter Damrosch brought his vision to life by closely collaborating with philanthropist Andrew Carnegie and architect William Burnet Tuthill, along with W.S. Hawk, John W. Aitken, and John J. Wilson. These six men composed the new board of directors of the Music Hall Company of New York, Limited, a stock company (Peyser) which managed the early development of Carnegie Hall.</p>
<p>One of the greatest achievements of Carnegie Hall is that it remedied the poor acoustic problem experienced by the Philharmonic when it performed in other NYC venues. Damrosch praises Tuthill for his acoustic architectural design: “Thanks to the professional skill of architect, William Burnet Tuthill, and some of the musicians whom he consulted, the acoustics of the Hall is remarkable--unexcelled by that of any other auditorium in the country” (Peyser). Thus, Carnegie Hall established the most ideal venue for the New York Philharmonic.</p>
