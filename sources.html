    <h1 class = "bio">Graziano, John Michael. European Music and Musicians in New York City, 1840-1900. Rochester, NY: U of Rochester, 2006. 93-134. Print. </h1>
    <p>This book is a compilation of different essays that helps depict the influence of European music in the music scene in New York in the 1840's to 1900. For our research project, we will be specifically paying attention to the essays regarding Leopold Damrosch and the essays that gives an insight to the influence of German immigration-and perhaps Irish- on the music scene in New York. Although the Damrosch essay focuses on Damrosch as a composer rather than a conductor, seeing his composer side will help us with our thesis as it will give us more insight on the music preferences that he had and maybe also give reasons as to why he had such preferences. Furthermore, the essays regarding the different immigrant population in New York will give us a background information on the possible social factors that could have influenced the types of music that Damrosch and Gustav might have chosen as a conductor.</p>

    <h1 class = "bio"> Horowitz, Joseph. Classical Music in America: A History of Its Rise and Fall. 1st ed. New York: W.W. Norton, 2005. Print.</h1>
    <p>This book depicts the characteristics of classical music and points out the difference between the American classical music and European classical music. It also describes where the American classical music drew its influences from- which was mainly from Europe. This book was specifically useful to gain a background understanding of the what the music scene looked like before the New York Philharmonics. It was difficult to know how the New York Philharmonics impacted the U.S. without knowing what the classical music scene looked like in the U.S. beforehand. Thus, this book was helpful in learning the early characteristics of the classical music in the U.S. and there were also sections that explained the creation of the New York Philharmonics and the different impacts the early conductors had on the orchestra. It also explicitly pointed out what made American classical music distinct from its European origins. </p> 

    <h1 class = "bio">Martin, George Whitney. The Damrosch Dynasty: America's First Family of Music. Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin, 1983. Print.</h1>
    <p>The Damrosch Dynasty chronicles the history of the first three generations of the Damrosch family-- the German immigrants heralded for their notable contributions to the culture of American orchestra and chamber music. Author George Martin presents the book as the first of it's kind, the only book comprised of personal accounts sourced from surviving Damrosch family members. This collective family memory serves to offer readers a look at how exactly the Damrosch family contributed to an American music legacy. When working with the New York Philharmonic dataset, we found it imperative to first survey the popular conductors and leaders who spearheaded most programming efforts. By first acknowledging the individual preferences and dispositions held by various conductors, one might later understand trends and movements related to the trajectory of the New York Philharmonic. Outside of simply offering a linear family history, Damrosch Dynasty also presents readers with invaluable information regarding Damrosch relations to various composers, conductors, and peers in the field. By honing in on the relationships between individuals, we’re hoping to link historical timelines with palpable information presented in the dataset. In other words, using the interpersonal relationships between conductors and participants to comprehend ideas of artistic influence, spikes in musical trends, and so on. </p>

    <h1 class = "bio">Peyser, Ethel. The House that Music Built: Carnegie Hall. New York City, NY: Robert M. McBride &amp; Company, 1936. Print.</h1>
    <p>This book is about the history and creation of Carnegie Hall and how the building transformed New York City’s musical scene. Our group is interested in learning about the impact of the active composers from the early years of the New York Philharmonic, specifically about the Damrosch brothers. In certain chapters of The House that Music Built: Carnegie Hall (“Introduction” by Walter Damrosch, “In the Room of the Board of Directors”, “The Opening Festival—May 5, 1981”, “Compositions Make Their Débuts”), the author discusses the relationship between Andrew Carnegie and Walter Damrosch in the building of Carnegie Hall. The NY Phil performed all over the world, but Carnegie Hall served as their home base. Although our group does not plan to focus on the history of NY Phil venues, we believe that because Walter Damrosch was highly involved in the formation of both NY Phil and Carnegie Hall, that it would be important to examine the relationship between the creation of the space and the music community that it built. </p>

    <h1 class = "bio">Shanet, Howard. Philharmonic: A History of New York’s Orchestra. Garden City, NY: Doubleday &amp; Company Inc., 1975. Print.</h1>
    <p>This book recounts the history of the New York Philharmonic orchestra and the surrounding music culture that it both impacted and was influenced by from its creation in 1842 up to 1975. This resource is able to give a lot of insight not only into the formation and development of the philharmonic, but also how it acted as a cultural mirror to reflect american life at the time. Our project will be focusing on the impact of early conductors in the new york philharmonic, and this text will allow us to understand not only how these conductors influenced the orchestra, but also how they in turn influenced or were influenced by American society.</p>
    
    <h1 class = "bio">Spitzer, John. American Orchestras in the Nineteenth Century. Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 2012. Print.</h1>
    <p>American Orchestras in the Nineteenth Century focuses on the orchestras and programs that developed in the nineteenth century. It has information on the European, and specifically German, influence on American orchestras during this time as well as information about the NY Philharmonic Orchestra during Leopold Damrosch’s time as music director. This is important to our research because we are looking specifically at the ways that the Damrosch family impacted the American orchestra, particularly how their seasons as music directors compared to the seasons of other music directors. Additionally, it offers a nice background about what the American orchestra was like in the nineteenth century in general, in terms of audience, arrangements, and tours, which will also be helpful for our narrative.</p>

    <h1 class = "bio">Wagner, Mary H. Gustav Mahler and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra Tour America. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, 2006. Print.</h1>
    <p>Gustav Mahler and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra Tour America depicts the last 2 years of the prolific conductor and composer Gustav Mahler’s life, during which he took on a leadership role to revive the waning popularity of the New York Philharmonic for the season of 1909 and 1910.  The book contains the specific details on how he revived the philharmonic, for instance - tripling the number of concerts, to appeal to the American masses.  This resource is important in that he is one of the composers in our dataset, and while he is only seen in 2 years out of the 70 years that is included in this dataset, we can see this as a turning point for the orchestra.  Perhaps, the end of the dataset being 1911 is explained by Mahler’s death in 1911: as the end of the pre-modern NY Philharmonic.  This resource is relevant to our thesis in that Mahler is the epitome of an excellent conductor, who could then be compared to the Damrosch family and their contribution to the Philharmonic.  This is to answer the question of how influential Damrosch exactly was in affecting the NY Philharmonic. Furthermore, Mahler’s European descent could help add to the conversation of the European influence on the NY Philharmonic.  </p>

    <h1 class = "bio">"Walter Damrosch." New York Philharmonics. N.p., n.d. Web. 28 Nov. 2016.</h1>
    <p>This webpage gives a biography of Walter Damrosch and points out his most significant works that helped the New York Philharmonics. This page was useful to get a quick understanding of the impact he had on the New York Philharmonics and had even brought up points that other books failed to mention. Most of the books only put an emphasis on his failure as a conductor or the financial influence he had on the philharmonics. Thus, this source was useful in getting additional facts on his influence in the New York Philharmonics. </p>
