Though his single season at the NY Philharmonic was less successful than his predecessor and successor, Leopold Damrosch brought novel, highly German influenced programs that often featured the works of Wagner and Berlioz. He was a prominent musical figure in New York; he founded a mixed chorus called the Oratorio Society in 1873 as well as the Symphony Society of the City of New York in 1878.</p>

Despite being more famous than his father Leopold Damrosch, Carnegie believed Walter Damrosch was not as skilled at conducting as his father was (Horowitz). The New York Philharmonic website even described Walter Damrosch's season as a conductor "almost as ruinous as Leopold's." While the public believed him to be lacking in his musical abilities, Walter’s entrepreneurial skills allowed him to contribute greatly during his time as a conductor (Horowitz). His connections with Carnegie allowed him to help pioneer the construction of Carnegie Hall.</p>

    <h1 class="text-center">Conductors' Influence on the NY Philharmonic's Financial Success</h1>
    <div class = "row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p>In 1866, Carl Bergmann took over as the first permanent conductor of the NY Philharmonic, following a 13-year period of sharing conducting duty with Theodore Eisfeld. He came to be associated with the “new music” of Wagner, Liszt, Berlioz, Schumann, and Brahms, and he advanced the quality of the Philharmonic’s performances. Bergmann’s popular choice of music began the association of German-serious music with “high-class” music making in New York (Shalet). From 1867 to 1873, he almost tripled the amount of revenue brought in, from $10,000 to $27,000, growing the Philharmonic to new heights. This is shown in the graph with a steep increase in revenue from 1873 to 1869 and then a steady increase in revenue through 1873. Although the press had praised the Philharmonic in the beginning for being so open to the public, the Philharmonic’s Director began to become more exclusive on which newspaper outlet they wanted to advertise on. This consequently made the press to become more bitter towards the Philharmonic, causing them to write biased reviews on the concerts― stating that not many people attended the concerts even though in reality, many people had attended. This also influenced the public, making them also formulate a negative view towards the Philharmonic (Shanet).  There was also increasing competition from Theodore Thomas’s private orchestra, and when the financial Panic of 1873 occurred, the Philharmonic’s success plummeted which was clearly depicted in the revenue bar graph. From pulling in a revenue of around $27,000, by 1877 the revenue quickly dropped to only around $7,000. Bergmann declined with the orchestra and the Philharmonic’s management accused him of growing increasingly lazy and negligent. The talented Bergmann, who had once made the Philharmonic into a great orchestra in the German image, was now so sloppy and depressed that he was asked to resign from his position in 1876 (Shalet). He died shortly after.</p>
    <p>After Bergmann’s death, the New York Philharmonic asked Thomas to be their conductor, but he declined as it would have required him to stop being the conductor of the Brooklyn Philharmonic. Consequently, the NY Philharmonic hired Leopold Damrosch to conduct for the 1876-1877 season. Damrosch had been a member of Franz Liszt’s inner circle back in Germany and had become a prominent musical figure in New York since his arrival there in 1871.</p></div>

    <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p> Unfortunately, Damrosch was unable to bring the New York Philharmonic back to its former prestige it had experienced before 1873 (Spitzer). The receipts were the lowest in 15 years, at only $8,000 (Shanet)-- depicted in the graph as the continuous decline of the NY Philharmonic’s revenue during the 1876-1877 season. This somewhat disastrous season was caused by the general effects of economic downturn of the Panic of 1873, coupled with competition from Theodore Thomas’s orchestra and Damrosch’s choice of music. Composers that Damrosch admired, such as Wagner and Berlioz, were unfamiliar to most American audience and did not appeal to their music preferences (Spitzer). </p>
    <p>After an unsuccessful season with Leopold Damrosch the NY Philharmonic sought after Thomas again. This time they were successful as they allowed him to continue conducting his own private orchestra. Immediately after Thomas took over, the revenue for the season increased drastically―from $8,500 to $13,000―but the year after, Thomas left New York to accept a position as head of a new College of Music in Cincinnati. His departure was clearly felt. The revenue that the Philharmonic brought in dropped down even lower to $7,000. Thus, after another unsuccessful season without him, the NY Philharmonic recruited him again. In the end, he agreed to commute between Cincinnati and New York to conduct the 6 concerts and 6 public rehearsals in the 1879 season. He then settled back in New York, and led the Philharmonic to much popularity and success for the next 11 years (Shalet). Under his leadership from 1879-1891, the philharmonic grew in financial prosperity―as shown in the revenue graph―,artistic progress, and civic respect, showing just how instrumental he was to the success of the Philharmonic in those years. He greatly improved the orchestra and reshaped Philharmonic according to his own rigorous standards. He continued Bergmann’s legacy by mainly choosing music composed by German composers, which continued to exposure to German culture. In 1891, although in the peak of his success, Thomas became frustrated with the part-time nature of the Philharmonic, and left New York. He then traveled to Chicago with his dream of a permanent orchestra, and established one of the strongest of German music program in America by the time he died in 1905 (Shalet).</p></div>

    <h1 class="text-center"> The Impact of Tours</h1>
    <p>Mahler standardized tours in the Philharmonic as he toured outside New York for recognition and profit.  The first and only tour in the history of the orchestra was conducted by Walter Damrosch in the 1903-1904 season, but his was largely unsuccessful. One of the problems with Walter’s tour was that it was too ambitious.  He often had over 100 musicians go to tour with him, but as the musicians were not full-time employees, he would have to hire substitutes for the many part-time musicians who would miss performances.  Furthermore, Walter often engaged local chorus from the cities he toured in, invited guest musicians,  and soloists.  All of these contributed to the needless expense that made the tour unprofitable.</p>
    <p>Mahler reintroduced the tours and succeeded in making it profitable in the 1909-1910 season by having less musicians, not hiring soloists or guest conductors, and choosing optimal routes for the tour. The extent of the tours is shown in the tour map above, which displays the cities that both Walter Damrosch and Mahler held their tours in. From the map, it is evident that Mahler’s tours were more condensed by focusing on states near New York, where people are more likely to be potential attendees to the main orchestras held in New York. Before Walter Damrosch and Mahler, the concerts were only held within New York, and almost exclusively in Manhattan.  Mahler standardized the tours by introducing cost-effective tours.  He managed 5 tours in 1909-1910 season, and 14 concerts the following season. These tours not only allowed the Symphony to gain recognition, it also greatly increased their revenue (Wagner). </p>
