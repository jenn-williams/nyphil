    <h2>Data Critique</h2>
    </div>
            <div class="container">
                <p>The New York Philharmonic Leon Levy Digital Archives (http://archives.nyphil.org/) can be freely accessed by the public. By embracing the open data movement, the NY Philharmonic encourages individuals to delve into the data and deduce their own conclusions. In this way, the data does not push a particular narrative or argument upon the user.</p> 
                <p>Within the New York Philharmonic Leon Levy Digital Archives, the <a href = "https://github.com/nyphilarchive/PerformanceHistory/">New York Philharmonic Performance History Dataset</a> includes information about the concerts performed by the Philharmonic between December 7, 1842 and April 2, 1911. As a spreadsheet, the ontology structures the information into rows and columns. The columns are arranged in order of specificity, beginning with the most general column of data: season. A season is defined as lasting between September 1 through August 31 of the following year. Each season is composed of multiple programs with corresponding dates, times, locations, and venues. The program identification codes are linked with work titles and corresponding work identification codes. Each work is connected to an orchestra (New York Philharmonic, Musicians from the New York Philharmonic, New York Symphony), composer, and conductor. Some works have movements or soloists; soloists are linked to their name, instrument, and role. </p>

                <p>The NY Philharmonic Leon Levy Digital Archives includes additional information, such as a the Subscribers Project: 1883 - 1907 (http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/subscribers) with links to the original documents and the complete <a href="http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/open-data">New York Philharmonic Subscribers Database: 1883 - 1997</a>. The Archive also has digitized images of the <a href = "http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/search?search-type=singleFilter&search-text=%2A&doctype=program&sort-order=asc&sort-column=npp:SortDate&page=1">original programs</a>, <a href= "http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/search?search-type=singleFilter&search-text=*&doctype=printedMusic&search-dates-from=&search-dates-to=">scores</a>, <a href= "http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/search?search-type=singleFilter&search-text=%2A&doctype=part">parts</a>, <a href="http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/search?search-type=singleFilter&search-text=%2A&doctype=visual">images</a>, and <a href = "http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/search?search-type=singleFilter&search-text=*&doctype=businessRecord&search-dates-from=&search-dates-to=">business documents</a>. Contents of the Leon Levy Digital Archives continue to grow, and will include audio recordings, videos, press clippings, and concert magazines in the future. In the “Considerations” portion of the archive, the Archivist and Historian, Barbara Haws notes that there are “additional records on ticket price, subscription series, and concert hall configuration” and that she can be contacted for inquiries about the data. </p>

                <p>The New York Philharmonic Performance History database was generated by extracting and archiving data from the original program pamphlets. Although the spreadsheet does not include the <a href = "http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/search?search-type=singleFilter&search-text=%2A&doctype=program&sort-order=asc&sort-column=npp:SortDate&page=1">digitized pamphlets</a> themselves, users can access the pamphlets on the digital archive. By analyzing the data, our team saw trends regarding the conductors, soloists, composers, programs, works, venues, and locations. The dataset illustrates the popularity of works and composers and the activity of conductors. The dataset also reveals the number of performances for each season, and how much the Philharmonic traveled from one season to the next. </p>

                <p>The dataset can only offer so much information, and inevitably leaves out certain information. The classification system of the dataset, or ontology, demonstrates what information is prioritized by the NY Philharmonic as an institution. The ontology allows for some flexibility; the rows can expand by including data about works with multiple movements or soloists. Interestingly, the dataset’s ontology reflects how the orchestral programs were organized and presented to the audience, and their preferential treatment of certain individuals. </p>

                <p>When flipping through digitized program pamphlets, the folio format offers no information about the orchestral musicians in the Philharmonic. The textual information on the pamphlets include the name of the name of the orchestra, season, venue, date, time, parts (grouping the works), works, movements, composers, conductors, and soloists. Besides the soloists, musicians are not credited in the dataset. Crediting composers, conductors, and soloists in both the programs and dataset reveal that the NY Philharmonic valued these individuals the most. Other musicians remain anonymous. The only gesture of acknowledgement lies in the orchestra’s name (New York Philharmonic, Musicians from the New York Philharmonic, New York Symphony), an acknowledgement through association. The inequality in recognition among the musicians and conductors establishes a hierarchy of importance. In this ontology, musicians are portrayed as being less significant than the conductors, composers, and soloists. Without musician data, we are unable to extract findings about the Philharmonic’s musician demographic, their involvement, and how their time working at the Philharmonic impacted their career.</p>

                <p>Ontologically, the dataset adopts an inward perspective about the Philharmonic’s activity, and struggles to capture data about the Philharmonic's impact upon society. The dataset lacks a humanistic and outward perspective regarding the relationship between the institution and their listeners. It would be interesting to analyze how the Philharmonic influenced the musicians and music preferences in New York City, and how their tours influenced music throughout the U.S. Instead, information regarding their societal impact can be found in written documents (link to bibliography) and by uncovering trends and relationships in the dataset.</p>

                <p><a href = "http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/subscribers">The Subscriber Project: 1883 - 1907</a>, could provide information about the community surrounding the NY Philharmonic. However, there’s no information about the subscribers from 1842 to 1883. Furthermore, the subscribers only represent a portion of the Philharmonic’s audience demographic. Initially, subscribers were the only performance attendees, but later subscribers were allowed to sell their tickets to others. The identities of non-subscriber attendees are not included in the dataset, and so the Philharmonic’s audience data is incomplete. Furthermore, the dataset does not include information relating to the number of audience members attending each performances. Without this data, it is difficult to generalize which conductors, composers, and works were most favored by the general population. </p>
