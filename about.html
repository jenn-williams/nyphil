    <h2>About</h2>

    <h2 class = "bio">Project Process</h2>
    <h1 class = "bio">Sources:</h1>
    <p>For our project, we were presented with a dataset chronicling the concerts held by the New York Philharmonic from 1842-1911, made available by the New York Philharmonic Performance History database. In "The Narrativization of Real Events", contemporary narratologist Hayden White comprehends narrative as the connective tissue between assembled facts. When dealing with our dataset, we aimed to tell the story of the roots and conception of the New York Philharmonic. This includes the social and historical context that grounded classical music in the 19th century. The NYP database was created by extracting information from primary source documents, such as pamphlets, printed programs, and other available ephemera. The project also used supplementary materials from Barbara Haws, the head archivist for the New York Philharmonic. This includes scanned ticket price documents and floor plans for early NYP venues. We also utilized additional data regarding the amount of revenue made annually-- taken from the New York Philharmonic Digital Archive’s annual reports. </p><br />


    <h1 class = "bio">Processing:</h1>
    <p>We first used OpenRefine to clean the data, getting rid of any redundancies and fixing formatting issues. We soon discovered that there were over 50 different conductors that conducted during this time period. In order to narrow down our narrative, we decided to mainly focus on the 5 main early conductors: Gustav Mahler, Leopold Damrosch, Carl Bergmann, Theodore Thomas, Walter Damrosch. We also used OpenRefine to create new datasets containing only these conductors. In addition to OpenRefine, we also used Excel to compile the revenue data that we acquired from the annual reports since there wasn’t too much data. Cleaning and narrowing down our research field allowed us to have a more focused data visualizations. Through the help of head archivist Barbara Haws, the project utilized scanned floor plans and seating charts for Carnegie Hall and the Metropolitan Opera House. </p><br />

    <h1 class = "bio">Presentation:</h1>
    <p>For our project, we chose to simply use HTML, CSS, and bootstrap to create our website. We felt like Wordpress and Omeka were too structured and would not give us the freedom to choose how we wanted to display our narrative. We specifically chose this layout with the intention of giving the viewer less explicit guidelines on how to navigate through the site.  For our Overview Timeline we used Timeline JS3 to give the viewer a comprehensive understanding of the historical events of the NYP. The Financial Revenue Graph was created through Tableau. We first tried using Excel to create the graph, however, we soon found that Excel did not offer an annotating ability, which we also needed to overlay on top of the revenue trend in order to help depict who the conductor was at that specific time.  All venue and tour maps were created via CartoDB. The stacked bar graphs were created using Excel as we wanted a basic way to visualize German influence upon various New York Philharmonic conductor. <p><br />
